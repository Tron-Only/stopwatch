# 🕒 Stopwatch Project

A super basic (but kinda cool) stopwatch made with JavaScript. It starts, stops, and resets—what more could you want? Oh, it also shows milliseconds because why not flex that precision?

## Features

- **Start**: Makes time go brrrrr 🚀
- **Stop**: Pauses time (not scientifically proven to alter spacetime) ⏸️
- **Reset**: Brings everything back to zero like my motivation on Mondays 🔄

## How It Works

- Uses `Date.now()` to track time (fancy, I know).
- Splits time into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (because we’re extra like that).
- Updates every 10ms to make it _look_ smooth (even if your browser cries a little).

## Why Does This Exist?

I was bored, JavaScript was there, and now we have a stopwatch. The end.

(Also, it’s a good beginner project to understand intervals and time calculations.)

Made with ✨ and `setInterval()` by someone who just learned `Date.now()` is a thing.
